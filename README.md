## 2. Automated ML with a large dataset
### **Description:**  
Students were tasked with a Classification and Regression problem.
Using a dataset from consumers banks with over 1M observations, we had to *classify* customers vs non-customers, and we had to *predict* the total sales a customer would generate, and the Number (count) of products they would purchase. I performed data quality inspection, exploration, model training and testing.

I produced 4 candidate models for each target variable and provided a deployment strategy after obtaining the model results on the test data.

Data exploration was performed with Base R and packages like ggplot/corrplot/tidy/dplyr
Some modeling was done with caret, but H20's AutoML package made much of these results possible.
AutoML allowed me to train 50+ iteration of each individual modeling technique I was considering as a solution to the classification/regression problem at hand.

Modeling techniques I chose for this analysis included:
  - Gradient Boosting Method (GBM)
  - Artificial Neural Network
  - Distributed Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
  - Ensemble Methods

## 3. Data Exploration and Regularized Regression analysis in R
### **Description:**  
Using the Diabetes data set from R, I performed data exploration to observe distributions, correlations, and outliers present in the predictor set.
Using that knowledge, I then moved forward with Regression analysis, and interpreted the results.

Regression models included:
- Linear
- Best Subset
- LASSO
- Ridge

## 4. Data Exploration with College Scorecard Data set
### **Description:**  
Using the College Scorecard data set from the US Department of education I was tasked with performing exploratory dat analysis. This data set contained over 3200 individual features. I narrowed my focus to selected variables within the following categories: 
  - Demographic factors (Segregated and Co-ed universities)
  - Financial Aid (Pell Grant, Federal loan %s)
  - Student Outcomes (completion rate)
  - Student Financial Outcomes (default rate , completion rate)
  - Institutional factors (size, 2 yr or 4 yr degree, Public/Private, Cost of attendance)
